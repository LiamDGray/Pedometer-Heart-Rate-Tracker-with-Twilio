Project for Twilio Signal Conf proposal. This app gets your heart rate, number of steps, distance walked, and a few other fitness statistics (depending on which you want or decide) with the Apple Watch and iOS HealthKit (requesting permissions.) It uses Twilio to send an SMS to a friend (whose number you enter into the iPhone app) when your heart rate is pumping high enough, or when you hit a certain number of steps or walk/run a certain distance. This makes for a fun fitness competition between friends, a way to have accountability, and has other health applications as well.
